# Bash Script Collection 

## Description

Welcome to my personal collection of Bash scripts! This repository contains a variety of scripts that I have created for various purposes, such as automating tasks, managing systems, and more.


## Installation

To use these scripts, you will need to have Bash installed on your system. Most Unix-based systems, such as Linux and macOS, come with Bash pre-installed. If you are using a Windows system, you can install Bash by enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or by using a Bash emulator like Cygwin.

## Usage

Once you have Bash set up, you can copy or download the script to run a Bash script:
You may need to give the script executable permissions first using the chmod command.
For example:
chmod +x path/to/kill_open_files.sh

## How to Contribute

If you have any suggestions for improvements or new scripts to add to this collection, please feel free to open a pull request. I am always looking for ways to make these scripts more useful and efficient.

I hope these scripts will be helpful to you in your own projects!
