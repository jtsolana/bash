Bash Script Collection
Welcome to my personal collection of Bash scripts! This repository contains a variety of scripts that I have created for various purposes, such as automating tasks, managing systems, and more.

Getting Started
To use these scripts, you will need to have Bash installed on your system. Most Unix-based systems, such as Linux and macOS, come with Bash pre-installed. If you are using a Windows system, you can install Bash by enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or by using a Bash emulator like Cygwin.

Once you have Bash set up, you can use the following command to run a Bash script:

Copy code
bash path/to/kill_open_files.sh
You may need to give the script executable permissions first using the chmod command. For example:

Copy code
chmod +x path/to/kill_open_files.sh

Here is a brief overview of the scripts included in this collection:

kill_open_files.sh: Kill all processes of deleted files that are still open

script2.sh: Description of script 2

script3.sh: Description of script 3

Contributing
If you have any suggestions for improvements or new scripts to add to this collection, please feel free to open a pull request. I am always looking for ways to make these scripts more useful and efficient.
